# Video Transcriber Skill

Process raw videos: transcribe, clean, and trim dead space automatically.

## When to Use

When the user:
- Says he recorded new videos
- Provides a video file path
- Provides a video URL (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)
- Asks to "process", "transcribe", or "trim" a video

## How to Run

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/video-transcriber/scripts/transcribe.py "VIDEO_PATH_OR_URL" --title "Title"
```

**Required:**
- `VIDEO_PATH_OR_URL` - The video file or URL
- `--title` - A short title for the video (used for folder/file names)

**Optional:**
- `--no-trim` - Skip dead space trimming

## What It Does

1. Downloads video (if URL)
2. Transcribes with Whisper
3. Fixes spelling (Claude, n8n, Remotion, etc.)
4. Removes false starts and repeated takes
5. Trims dead space (pauses > 0.4s)
6. Outputs everything to a project folder

## Output

Creates folder in `~/your-project/raw-videos/`:

```
Title-Name/
├── Title-Name.mov              (original)
├── Title-Name-trimmed.mov      (USE THIS - dead space removed)
├── Title-Name-transcript.txt   (readable transcript)
└── Title-Name-timestamps.json  (for captions/editing)
```

## Example Prompts

- "Process this video: ~/Downloads/video.mov"
- "I just recorded a video about Claude Code, it's in my downloads"
- "Transcribe and trim: https://instagram.com/reel/xyz"

## After Running

Tell the user:
1. Where the trimmed video is
2. How much time was saved
3. Show transcript preview
